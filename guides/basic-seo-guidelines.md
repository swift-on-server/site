# Basic SEO guidelines

## Keywords

### Primary & secondary keywords (PK, SK)

- Choose one strong primary keyword as a target
- Select about 5 relevant secondary keywords

### Keyword density: 

- 2-5% total keyword density (including primary, secondary & synonyms)
- 1-2% PK density (one or two occurrences per a 100 words)

### PK Appearance (by ranking factors)

- Title (PK in the beginning)
- URL (PK in the beginning)
- H1, H2, H3, H4 tags (H1 is the best option)
- Image (alt text over name, include at least one image)
- Description (meta, excerpt, PK in the beginning)
- Paragraphs (first, last)
- Anchor text

### Example

PK:
	- swift log[ging]

SK: 

    - swift console log
    - how to log in swift
    - ios swift log[ging]
    - os_log swift
    - swift debug log
    - swift xcode log to console

## Content Length

### URL (permalink)

- under 120 characters

### Title

- 50–60 characters

### Meta description / excerpt

- 50–160 characters

### Blog posts

- Short post: 500 - 1000words 
- Average post: 1000 - 2000 words
- Ideal post: 2000 - 2500 words
- Pillar post: 2500 - 4000 words


## Content writing

### TF-IDF

During a Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) check, we look at the top 10 pages for a keyword using the search engine. Based on the content we analyze the occurrence of each word in the documents and compare it to our own page. The result will give us hints about which words we should use more and less.

### Tips

- Each SK should be used at least once
- Use semantic search results to reinforce your keywords
- Internal links to the page (next to the PK anchor text)
- Outbound links from the page (related content on high quality sites)
- Use the section HTML element to semantically separate content blocks

### Anchor texts

- 65% - Branded (e.g. Swift Contents)
- 20% - Naked link (e.g. swift-contents.org)
- 5% - Generic (e.g. click here) 
- 3% - Brand + keyword (e.g. Swift Contents about logging)
- 3% - Keyword variation (e.g. how to use swift logging)
- 2% - Partial match (e.g. cool swift log solutions)
- 1% - Exact match (e.g. swift logging)
- 1% - Image (e.g. link on image with alt text)
